# Snake-game-in-python


There are a number of ways to create this game, and one includes the use of Pythonâ€™s PyGame library, which is a Python library we use to create games.

The other way is through the use of the turtle library. This module comes pre-installed with Python, and it provides a virtual canvas for users to create shapes and pictures.

Therefore, this project uses the turtle library to implement a simple snake game, which is easier and faster to develop.
